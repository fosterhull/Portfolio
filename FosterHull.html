        <h4>My Role:</h4> <!--Bold Subheadings(Smaller than numbered titles + bolded)-->
            <ul>
                <li> Collaborate with team members and student body to plan and execute exciting concert programming </li><!--Small Text (List Items, Same Size as "p" Items)-->
                <li> Communicate closely with our agent and artist to facilitate a smooth event process </li>
                <li> Develop designs for newsletters and posters, as well as employ other necessary advertising strategies to increase student body attendance </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Our Success:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> While in my position as a co-chair of the concerts committee at Luther College we were struggling to get turn-out at concerts. We had about 450 students at the concert when I was a sophomore, out of a student body of about 2,000. I began working in the position at the end of my sophomore year and throughout the year our team collaborated heavily on restructuring the format of choosing artists. We created a bracket system in which the student body chose the artist for the following fall semester. By the time of the fall concert of 2024 the student body had shrunk to just shy of 1,600. The attendance for that concert was over 700. Obviously there are further details that contributed to that outcome, however my passion and collaboration with other members of the Student Activities Council to re-establish Luther concerts among the student body was very evident throughout this process and it paid off.  </li>
            </ul>

    </div>


        <h4>My Role:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Develop student-accessible social media posts, stories, and advertising materials  </li>
                <li> Collaborate with executive members in order to effectively portray our intentions as an organization through our first official event </li>
                <li> Promote philanthropy and community-building at Luther College and throughout the larger Decorah community </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Our Success:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> After successfully becoming an active student organization on campus in the Fall of 2024, our executive board decided
                    we wanted to hold our first fundraising event for the Northeast Iowa Humane Society (HSNEI) before the winter break in order to promote our organization early on. We were able to 
                    request and recieve funding from the student senate, which enabled us to hold such an event. We decided to do a candy
                    gram event leading up to the holidy break, in which people could purchase "secret santa" gift bags for $2. We initially
                    set our goal to raise $100 for this event...... We raised over $500 to present to the HSNEI before leaving for break. This was a fantastic experience for me and our team
                    in which we set an impressive precedent for future fundraising and event planning. As the sole fraternity on campus, we 
                    are striving to go against stereotypical greek life expectations and focus more on the community and philanthropy that
                    is desired among male students at Luther College.  </li>
            </ul>

<h2 class=numbertit>3. Visual Communications Senior Project</h2>

    <div class="img">
        <img src="3DCatan.png" alt="3D Modeled and Printed Catan Set ~Foster Hull">
        <img src="WesCatan.png" alt="Catan Wes Anderson Expansion Deck ~Foster Hull">
    </div>

        <h4>Design Process</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> In this capstone course students critically examine how complex visual communication strategies are conceptualized and deployed. This course also examines topical issues surrounding this expansive field. Students will apply principles and methods of visual media production as well as conduct research and analysis of critical dilemmas in Visual Communication. Students pursuing multiple majors are encouraged to discover ways that this capstone course intersects with their other disciplinary pursuits. </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Benefits:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> I landed on designing a full deck of custom Catan cards through the lens of Wes Anderson’s world of film. I wanted to create a fun deck of development cards that were more interactive between players. I achieved this by creating more cards with wider differentiation between their abilities in gameplay. By employing creative callbacks to key moments in 6 key Wes Anderson films, I aimed to attract a niche audience of Catan players who also may be familiar with Anderson’s work. Along with the deck of cards. </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Programs Utilized:</h4>

                <li> Adobe Illustrator </li>
                <li> Blender </li>

<h2 class=numbertit>4. Poster Designs</h2>

        <img src="Saint Motel Final Poster.png" alt="Saint Motel Poster I designed for Graphic Design I course">
        <img src="Hippo Campus Poster.png" alt="Hippo Campus Poster I designed for the concert at Luther College">
 
    </div>


        <h4>Design Expectations:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Using the images, fonts, and other materials approved by the band, create advertising to promote the upcoming concert.

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> Must be designed as if the concert is here at Luther and must include all necessary information for students who may want to attend</li>

<h2 class=numbertit>5. Graphic Design II Project: The Airline Ticket</h2>

    <div class="img">

        <img src="Office Ticket.png" alt="GreatScott Airline Plane Ticket" id="planetickets">
    </div>


        <h4>Project Description:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> The paper boarding pass is very much a utilitarian object. It has existed for one purpose: tell you where you are going and when. But just because it has a narrow function does not mean it needs to suffer from poor design.  </li>
                <li> This is where you come in. Taking into account all the information that needs to be addressed in the boarding pass, what information may (if any) be absent from the pass that could be useful, and the different potential audiences the pass will have, you are charged with the challenge of redesigning this slip of paper to improve both its function and its form. </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Requirement:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> Airline branding </li>
                <li> Passenger Name </li>
                <li> Departure City </li>
                <li> Destination City </li>
                <li> Boarding Time </li>
                <li> Flight Number </li>
                <li> Boarding Group </li>
                <li> Terminal </li>
                <li> Gate Number </li>
                <li> Seat Number </li>
                <li> Barcode </li>
            </ul>
